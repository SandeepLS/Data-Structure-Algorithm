The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

Example:-
5 % 2 = 1
5 / 2 = 2 remainder 1
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1

Explain:-
Let's go through your example, 5%2 = 1
  (i)5%2: Divide 5 by 2: 5/2=2 (Quotient is 2).
  (ii)Multiply the quotient by the divisor:2×2 = 4.
  (iii)Subtract this product from the original number: 5−4 = 1.

Ex: const remainder = 11 % 3;
O/P:-The value of remainder should be 2
