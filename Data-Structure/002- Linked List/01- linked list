LL:- is a linear Data structure, unlike array, LL are not stored at a contiguous memory location,
     It is bascically chain of node, each node contains information like data & a pointer to next node in the chain.
     There is a head pointer, where points to the first element of the LL.

(1)Single LL:-Navigation is Forward only.
(2)Doubly LL:-Forward & Backward navigation is possible.
(3)Circular LL:-Last element is linked to the First element.

(1)Single LL:- is a list made up of nodes, that consist of two parts.
Ex:- suppose we want to store a list numbers: 23, 54, 78, 90
Head
1000
      23|2000    54|3000    78|4000    90|NULL
       1000        2000      3000       4000
