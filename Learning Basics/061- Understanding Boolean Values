/*
Another data type is the Boolean.
Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. 
They are basically little on-off switches, where true is on and false is off. These two states are mutually exclusive.

//Ex:
function welcomeToBooleans() {
  // Only change code below this line

  return true; // Change this line

  // Only change code above this line
}
