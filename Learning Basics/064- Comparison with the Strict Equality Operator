/*
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). 
However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, 
the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

Examples:
3 ===  3  // true
3 === '3' // false

Test case:
Waiting:testStrict(10) should return the string Not Equal
Waiting:testStrict(7) should return the string Equal
Waiting:testStrict("7") should return the string Not Equal
Waiting:You should use the === operator
*/
function testStrict(val) {
  if (val === 7) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}
testStrict(10);
testStrict(7);
