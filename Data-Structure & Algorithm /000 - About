Data-Structure:- Is containers to store & organize data.
Algorithm:- Is accessing data-structure for some operation.

Example: Imagine, if am going to a goa trip, we need to pack for 3 days cloths,
In our suitcase, we need to hold multiple data like shirts, pant, sheos anything, known as Data-Structure.
If i want to fetch a shirt in my suitcase & first i need to find-out the shirt like,
all green colour-shirt, should be together, all read colour-shirt should be together, the item is organize together,
known as Algorithm. It helps we access the data-structure.

If i have some data,
how do i store it efficiently, &
how do i retrive the data correctly,
That is what Data-Structure & Algorithm.
