Introduction to Algorithms & Sorting Algorithms - I:-

-> Brief BluePrint.

-> Array: 
  is contigueos blocks of memory, where each block hold some data.
  Array are index data-structure, each blocks have index.
  ex: we want to store some list of data.
  const array = ["san", "man", "kanrna"];

  Problem-001:- rollNo: [1, 4, 6, 2, 5, 3, 8] Target=5 :-Using Linear Search
  Problem-002:- rollNo: [1, 4, 6, 2, 5, 3, 8] Target=5 :-Using Binary Search

Algorithms -> 1) Correctness | Accuracy -> Test cases
              2) Efficiency | Scalability

-> Time & Space Complexity:- 29:00s
  Relation between the Resources require & given code/Algo.
  It means: How much more resources we need, if i increas my input/parameters.
  
  Time complexity:- measures the number of operations, the algorithm performs relative to the input size. 
                    We are going to execute statements, How many times.
  Space complexity:- measures the memory, used by the algorithm, including input, output, and auxiliary variables.
                     Then we do not using, extra space.

-> Examples for Time complexity:- 45:00 to 1:26:00
  How to write BigO Notation:-
  > We only care about the largest polynomial.
  > We can ignore constants, smaller values.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorting Algorithm:-  1:27:00s
Bubble sort: The bigest bubble pops out first.
Ex: [4, 6, 1, 3, 2, 0] In each iteration, largest number should be placed correctly.
Approach: ai > ai+1 => swap.
1st iteration => [4, 1, 3, 2, 0, 6]
2nd iteration => [1, 3, 2, 0, 4, 6]
3rd iteration => [1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 6]
              => [1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 6]
              => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
So, N-1-iteration(It's telling which iteration am using)  :-1:37:30s
Problems No: 003 - Array using BubbleSort
