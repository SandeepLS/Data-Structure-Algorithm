/*
The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers.
If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true.
If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. 
Like the equality operator, the less than or equal to operator converts data types.

Examples
4   <= 5 // true
'7' <= 7 // true
5   <= 5 // true
3   <= 2 // false
'8' <= 4 // false

Add the less than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.

Tests
Passed:testLessOrEqual(0) should return the string Smaller Than or Equal to 12
Passed:testLessOrEqual(11) should return the string Smaller Than or Equal to 12
Passed:testLessOrEqual(12) should return the string Smaller Than or Equal to 12
Passed:testLessOrEqual(23) should return the string Smaller Than or Equal to 24
Passed:testLessOrEqual(24) should return the string Smaller Than or Equal to 24
Failed:testLessOrEqual(25) should return the string More Than 24
Passed:testLessOrEqual(55) should return the string More Than 24
Passed:You should use the <= operator at least twice
