/*
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time. 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Constraints:
0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

var longestConsecutive = function (nums) {
    let set = new Set(nums);
    let streak = 0;

    for(let num of set){
        if(set.has(num-1)) continue;
        let currStreak = 1;

        while(set.has(num+1)){
            currStreak++;
            num++;
        }
        streak = Math.max(streak, currStreak)
    }
    return streak;
};

/*
1)The code begins by creating a Set named set containing the elements of the input array nums. 
A Set is used to efficiently store unique elements and allows for constant-time lookups.
2)It initializes a variable streak to store the length of the longest consecutive sequence found so far. This variable will be updated as the algorithm progresses.
3)Next, it iterates through each element num in the set.
4)For each num, it checks if num-1 exists in the set. If it does, it means num is not the starting element of a consecutive sequence, so the loop skips to the next num.
5)If num-1 does not exist in the set, it means num is the starting element of a consecutive sequence. 
It initializes a variable currStreak to 1 (since num itself is part of the sequence).
6)It then enters a while loop that increments num and checks if num+1 exists in the set. 
If it does, it means the consecutive sequence continues, so currStreak is incremented, and num is updated to the next consecutive number.
7)Once the while loop ends, it updates the streak variable to the maximum value between the current streak and currStreak. 
This ensures that streak always stores the length of the longest consecutive sequence found so far.
8)After iterating through all elements in the set, the function returns the value of streak, which represents the length of the longest consecutive sequence in the input array nums.
