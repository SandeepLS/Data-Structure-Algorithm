Recursion:
is when a function call itself.
Why:A great technique to simplify your solution.
Every recursion solution, need to solve a base case- A condition to terminate the recursion.

(1)Recursive Fibonacci Sequence:-
Fibonaccci sequence is sequence, Which each number us sum of the, two preceding ones.
By default first two numbers present in sequence, they are 0 & 1.
recursiveFibonacci(0)= 0
recursiveFibonacci(1)= 1
recursiveFibonacci(6)= 8

Ex:
function recursiveFib(n){
    if(n < 2){
        return n;
    }
    return recursiveFib(n-1) + recursiveFib(n-2);
}
console.log(recursiveFib(1));
console.log(recursiveFib(2));
console.log(recursiveFib(6));
console.log(recursiveFib(7));
