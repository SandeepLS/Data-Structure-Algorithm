/*
In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. 
Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:
myVar = myVar + 5;

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.
*/
Ex:
  let a = 3;
  let b = 17;
  let c = 12;
  
  // Only change code below this line
  a += 12;
  b += 9;
  c += 7;
