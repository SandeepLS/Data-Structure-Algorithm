/**
Explanation of Approach:
1.Linear Search:
> This approach iterates through the array from the start to the end.
> At each iteration, the current element is checked against the target.
> If a match is found, the index is returned immediately.
> If the loop completes without finding the target, -1 is returned.

2.Why Linear Search?
> The array isn't sorted, so linear search is straightforward and effective for small to medium-sized arrays.
> Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Space complexity: O(1), as no additional memory is used apart from the loop variable.
