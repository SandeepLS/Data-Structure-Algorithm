Algorithms -> 1) Correctness | Accuracy -> Test cases
              2) Efficiency | Scalability

-> Time & Space Complexity:-
Relation between the Resources require & given code/Algo.
It means: How much more resources we need, if i increas my input/parameters.

Time complexity:- measures the number of operations, the algorithm performs relative to the input size.
Space complexity:- measures the memory, used by the algorithm, including input, output, and auxiliary variables.
