Def:-A data structure is defined as a, particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices,
    to use the data efficiently and effectively. 
    The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. 
    An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.

The complete process to learn DS from scratch can be broken into 3 parts:
  * Learn about Time and Space complexities
  * Learn the basics of individual Data Structures
  * Practice Problems on Data Structures

Complexity:-if a program written in a efficient or not. in that case we use Complexity.
  It has two types:-
  (a)Time complexity:-is used to, Measure the amount of time require, to execute the code.
  (b)Space complexity:-means, the amount of space required, to execute sucessfully the functionalities of code.
Both of the above complexities are measured with respect to the input parameters.
Auxiliary Space very commonly in DSA, which refers to the extra space used in the program.

DS:-In the computer world, How to organize the information, & hold it into the memory is called DS.
    There are several ways to organize the data, Ex:- In sequential(Array), Links one node to another(LinkedList) & Tress.

Algorithum:- In software industries we have some information, from that information we will get some insite, will do some analysis.
             Ex:- We will book cab in OLA or Uber, we will find the nearest cab driver from our location, in that case we need one algorithum.    
Algorithum is nothing but, set of steps, we should follw this type of step, then we will get solution.
